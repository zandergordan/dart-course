# Dart keywords by category

Here I have grouped all the keywords in Dart according to the function they serve.

## Functions
void  
covariant  (tightens parameter type by using a subtype as the function argument)
required 
return 
Function 

## class definition
abstract 
class 
enum 
extends 
extension 
factory 
get 
mixin 
new 
operator 
static 
super 
set 
this 
with 
implements 

## control flow
assert 
break 
case 
continue 
default 
do 
else 
for 
if 
in 
switch 
while 

## exception handling
catch 
finally 
rethrow 
throw 
try  

## variable declaration
const 
final 
late 
var 
dynamic 

## library
deferred 
export 
hide 
import 
library 
part 
show 

# Misc

These above represent the 6 major categories which most of the keywords fall into, but there are a few other miscellaneous ones as well:

as : type-casting operator
is : type-checking operator

null : built-in type value
true : built-in type value
false : built-in type value

async : Asynchrony support
await : Asynchrony support
sync :  specifies a synchronous generator

on : contextual keyword used for exception handling, defining extensions, and using mixins.

typedef : special keyword for defining a type alias

yield : generators
